1. MainPanel.backup()

This I changed to just make the backup 2d array to be equal to the original. Originally it went through 2 for loops to make it equal to the original.
Therefore this improvement was also a significant aid to performance.


2. MainPanel.convertToInt()

This method padded the number with 1000 zeroes and then made it into an int, this was not needed because the int passed in was the int needed.
I took out the call which helped performance but also changed the code in case it was used elsewhere.


3. MainPanel.calculateNextIteration()

This minor change just stopped the program from creating more objects since there was already a nextIter array and it was already declared in main.


4. MainPanel.runContinuous()

This change was done because a double for loop was used to do some calculation with _r, however after they were done _r was returned to normal and therefore
the arithmeticthat was  performed on it was not used.
